# OpenOSP EMR Community Edition

## What is OpenOSP EMR

OpenOSP EMR is an open-source electronic medical record system, originally forked from the "OSCAR" project created by Dr. David Chan at McMaster University. OpenOSP builds on this foundation, maintaining the customizable, open-source EMR code to provide managed EMR services to clinics across Canada. Since 2018, OpenOSP has maintained and shared this open-source codebase.

Note: OSCAR is a registered trademark of McMaster University. While OpenOSP is based on and has been further developed from the original OSCAR EMR codebase, it is not affiliated with McMaster University. All rights related to the OSCAR name are retained by McMaster University.

## About OpenOSP

OpenOSP is a member-owned cooperative, formed by clinicians for clinicians. Its structure allows profits to be reinvested into user-driven software development and service improvements, ensuring the platform evolves to meet the needs of healthcare professionals and their patients.

OpenOSP offers commercial EMR services, including cloud-hosted and on-site EMR solutions, as well as data migration from other EMR systems. This offering integrates telehealth tools, online booking, and connections for faxing and healthcare other systems.  OpenOSP's approach gives clinicians more control over their data, ensuring freedom from vendor lock-in.
