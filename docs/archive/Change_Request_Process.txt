OSCAR Change Request Process v1.0

To make a change in oscar and submit it for inclusion into the distribution you must first fill out a
Change Request (Change Request Template is available in this directory).  And submit it to the technical 
committee for review.  (Currently this is done on sourceforge as a feature request)

The Technical Committee has a two week turn around on submissions.  Submissions are first reviewed by the 
code review developers.  The code review developers can approve a request if it's minor and there is no reason
to reject it.  If the code review developers would like more input on the Change Request, it's deferred to the 
Technical Committee workgroup meeting.
