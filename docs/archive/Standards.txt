Oscar Standards
===============


Coding Standards
----------------

-No System.out or System.err can be used in the committed code.  Use the logger instead (Code_Logging.txt)
-No printStackTrace can be used in the committed code. Use the logger instead (Code_Logging.txt)



How to Report a Bug
-------------------

1.  Login to the oscar bug/feature tracker
    - currently we use the bug tracker on [sourceforge](https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=add&group_id=66701&atid=515432)
    This doesn't require a sourceforge account but it is incouraged so that you can have follow up when the bugs status changes.

2.  Set the category to the appropriate module.

3.  Add a good summary of the bug so that it can be easily identified in a list.

4.  Add a detailed description of the problem.  Including steps to recreate the problem.  Upload screen shots if you have them.
    Make sure there is not patient identifiable data visible.

5.  Click "Add Artifact" at the bottom.

Committing to the repository
----------------------------

Before committing you need to run the following ant command.

ant clean dist jspc codeCheck

This needs to build without errors.  It checks to make sure all java and jsp files compile and checks the source to validate that the coding standard is followed.

All commits must either have a bug/feature number as the first line of the commit message followed by a description of what has been changed.

eg.

    ID: 2344324
    Added Button to launch the search window.

*Note: This id will become an active link when viewed on the build server


How to submit a bug fix/feature request
---------------------------------------

A patch can be submitted to the mailing list or one of the developers with commit access.
