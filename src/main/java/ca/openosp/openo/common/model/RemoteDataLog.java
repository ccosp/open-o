/**
 * This class is a log table. It is used to keep track of what documents a provider has sent or retrieved from a remote system. The purpose is that we need to be able to audit what has or has not been sent or seen by the provider. In general no on will
 * ever look in this table so it's going to be modeled like a write-only log. Little to no consideration will be made for read/reporting purposes, that's not the intent for this table. In general code should no be reading from this table, you should not
 * attempt to use this table as a cache for remote data. You should not use this to determine what data has been synchronised with a server. This log should be written to each time data is retrieved from a remote server, not if it's retrieved / viewed from
 * a local cache like say if it's stored in the session space or an in memory cache.

     * server, also documentId's are not always unique as there can be imageId=444 and messageId=444. This fields is a string so it allows massive flexibility in shaping this key to be unique for the server the data is retrieved from. For data being sent,
     * this could be something like "myoscar.myserver.org:8080:message:", the url can still signify where it went and in the case of messages there is no local persistence of it so there's no id, if the example were a note, then the note id could be put there like "myoscar.myserver.org:8080:note:442"
