 * The purpose of this class is to provide a container for
 * progress information. The expected usage of this class is
 * that you may instantiate this class, then put it in
 * the HttpSession, then pass it to a long running task which would
 * then periodically update the contents of these variables.
 * It is then expected that something like another ehrweb page
 * may periodically refresh, and the contents of this class
 * maybe used to display the contents of that page. The completed
 * boolean should be set by the running task and the dialog can
 * use it to close the window upon completed.
 * <p>
 * An example maybe as follows
 * total="148 files"
 * processed="14 files read"
 * percentComplete=10
 * currentItem="foo.txt"
