/**
 * Caches attachments for the current message. Please remember to add {@link AttachmentCleanupInterceptor}
 * to the interceptor chain in order to remove cached attachments after processing.
 *
 * <h3>Implementation notes</h3>
 * 
 * This interceptor is invoked at {@link Phase.PRE_PROTOCOL} phase and expects attachments
 * to be already parsed and configured on the {@link Message} instance before it is invoked.
 * It then sets the attachments in the thread local scope for further processing.
 * 
 * <h3>ThreadLocal usage</h3>
 * 
 * The interceptor uses {@link ThreadLocal} to store the attachments in a thread-local context.
 * This ensures that the attachments are available to the current thread during message processing 
 * and can be retrieved via {@link #getAttachments()}. After processing, {@link #clear()} should 
 * be called to avoid memory leaks by removing the cached attachments from the thread-local storage.
