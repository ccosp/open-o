 * Cleans up attachments cached by {@link AttachmentCachingInterceptor}.
 * 
 * <h3>Purpose</h3>
 * 
 * This interceptor operates in the {@link Phase#POST_INVOKE} phase and is responsible for 
 * clearing attachments cached in the thread-local storage by the {@link AttachmentCachingInterceptor}. 
 * By doing so, it prevents potential memory leaks and ensures that the cached attachments 
 * are removed after message processing.
 *
 * <h3>Usage</h3>
 * 
 * This interceptor should be added to the interceptor chain following the {@link AttachmentCachingInterceptor} 
 * to ensure that attachments are cleaned up after they are no longer needed.
