    Consent form for personal information integration</b></font></h1>
<h2><a name="0.1__TOC8351"></a><font color="#2b6991" face="Helvetica Neue" size="3"><b>Summary</b></font></h2>
<p><font face="Helvetica Neue Light" size="2">Right now, you may have files in many different agencies. The idea of
    CAISI integration is to allow your doctors and caregivers at each agency to view the information in your files with
    your consent. You and other clients will receive better care if doctors or caregivers can understand your medical
    history and other socially relevant information at the agencies you have been to. This can be done by integrating
    (or allowing access to) your files from different agencies. This is CAISI's goal: to allow clients and agencies to
    integrate client records to improve client care. If you give consent, then each of the participating agencies
    (including individual physicians who have provided you with care) will be able to view information about you from
    the other participating agencies. </font></p>

<p><font face="Helvetica Neue Light" size="2">If you give permission to agencies using CAISI to integrate your records,
    only those doctors and caregivers who provide you with care and persons authorized by them will see your
    information. Your permission will also allow your information to be used for system management purposes and for
    non-identifying statistics. Your permission will also allow doctors and caregivers at these agencies to access your
    health number and a photo so they can confirm your identity and for billing purposes if you don't have your health
    card with you. Because homelessness is a social issue, participating agencies may seek to use your information,
    without identifying you, for research. Research will only be done if approved by a research ethics board.</font></p>
<p><font face="Helvetica Neue Light" size="2">You can change your mind and take back your permission to integrate your
    records and all future information sharing will stop, but information that has already been shared may have been
    recorded at other agencies and will remain in their files.&nbsp; &nbsp; </font></p>
<p><font face="Helvetica Neue Light" size="2">With few exceptions, you have the right to see what information this
    agency has about you. You can ask to see your records at this agency at any time and if you are allowed to see your
    records, you might have to wait 30 days after your first request.</font></p>
<p><font face="Helvetica Neue Light" size="2">You have rights and can ask questions about CAISI to understand what you
    are giving permission for. You may give permission or not give permission and the caregivers within this agency will
    respect this and this will not affect your care at this agency. If you need more time to make a decision, you may
    decide when you feel ready to make the decision. Your records will not be viewed at other agencies until you give
    permission. </font></p>
<h2><a name="0.1__TOC10293"></a><font color="#2b6991" face="Helvetica Neue" size="3"><b>The
    CAISI project and CAISI agencies</b></font></h2>
<p><font face="Helvetica Neue Light" size="2">CAISI wants clients and agencies to integrate care in order to end chronic
    homelessness. Many homeless people in Toronto stay on the streets or in shelters because their information is all
    over the place, including hospitals, shelters, and other healthcare providers. Nobody can see all this client
    information to understand their history and help them find housing. CAISI wants to help end this by letting many
    agencies talk to each other about the same client. CAISI hopes that this will help clients like you get better care
    and eventually possibly help with housing needs also. </font></p>
<p><font face="Helvetica Neue Light" size="2">CAISI has two main parts
    in it:</font></p>
<ol type="1">
    <li><font face="Helvetica Neue Light" size="2">Creating and
        taking care of the CAISI electronic system, as part of the CAISI project
        at St. Michael's Hospital.</font></li>
    <li><font face="Helvetica Neue Light" size="2">Helping agencies
        and community members use the CAISI electronic system, which includes
        the CAISI project team and participating agencies.</font></li>

</ol>
<h3><font face="Helvetica Neue" size="2"><b>What am I giving consent
    to?</b></font></h3>
<p><font face="Helvetica Neue Light" size="2">Your permission will allow this agency to let other agencies that give you
    care view information about you to provide better care for you. The participating agencies will each be able to view
    information about you from the other participating agencies. This will help doctors and caregivers understand your
    medical history and related information so they can make better decisions about your care. This will help providers
    of social services understand the care you have received so they can make better decisions about the social services
    they provide to you. If you give permission, then your information may be stored at other agencies if they have
    chosen to transfer that information into their file at their agency. The types of agencies that may participate in
    the integration are: individual physicians and healthcare institutions, other healthcare agencies, ambulance
    services, social services agencies (e.g., that provide assistance with housing, obtaining identification, etc.),
    shelters and drop-ins. Accompanying this consent is the list of agencies that are now and those that we hope will be
    part of the integration. The list of participating agencies may change in the future as agencies of the types listed
    above are added. The most current list is available on the CAISI website and you are welcome to look up the list of
    participating agencies at any time or, if you prefer, to ask us for it. </font></p>
<p><font face="Helvetica Neue Light" size="2">If you need services at other CAISI agencies, they will use your name and
    date of birth to check if you have given consent to CAISI somewhere else. If you have given permission, then they
    will view your information from other CAISI agencies. </font></p>
<p><font face="Helvetica Neue Light" size="2">The information that may be shared includes: &nbsp; </font></p>
<ul>
    <li><font face="Helvetica Neue Light" size="2">specific information about your identity and health number;</font>
    </li>
    <li><font face="Helvetica Neue Light" size="2">other information concerning your health such as your diagnosis
        (illnesses or diseases that you may have) and medications (drugs and medicines that you are taking);</font></li>
    <li><font face="Helvetica Neue Light" size="2">information concerning social services that you have accessed, such
        as services you received, issues that arose, notes from social service providers in relation to the care they
        provided to you; </font></li>
    <li><font face="Helvetica Neue Light" size="2">information about referrals that have been made for you to access
        social or healthcare services (such as addiction counseling). </font></li>
</ul>
<h3><font face="Helvetica Neue" size="2"><b>What happens if I don't
    give consent?</b></font></h3>

<h3><font face="Helvetica Neue Light" size="2">You will still receive
    the same care and services and your information will not be shared with
    other agencies. </font></h3>
<h3><font face="Helvetica Neue" size="2"><b>How will my information
    be used?</b></font></h3>
<p><font face="Helvetica Neue Light" size="2">Your information will be used to help ensure that the care and services
    you receive are coordinated across agencies. If the CAISI project ends, or it is determined that integration will be
    stopped, St. Michael's Hospital will safely and securely destroy all integrator related personal information. Each
    agency will retain custody and control of its own information.</font></p>
<p><font face="Helvetica Neue Light" size="2"><b>What are the benefits?</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Helvetica Neue Light" size="2">As a result of sharing
    your information, there may be opportunities to improve your care or
    reduce risks and costs. For example, sharing may help in reducing duplication
    of tests and procedures, which can help improve care, reduce costs and
    reduce risks at the same time. </font></p>

<h3><font face="Helvetica Neue" size="2"><b>What are the risks?</b></font></h3>
<h3><font face="Helvetica Neue" size="2">There is a risk that someone
    who is not supposed to see your information could try to access your
    information.&nbsp; CAISI does not allow this. CAISI and the participating
    agencies have rules and safeguards in place to only allow those who
    are giving you care to see your information. </font></h3>
<h3><font face="Helvetica Neue" size="2"><b>Who can see my information?</b></font></h3>

<p><font face="Helvetica Neue Light" size="2">Only your doctors and
    other people who give you care at an agency using CAISI can see your
    information. The list of these agencies is available for you to see.&nbsp;
    The CAISI project only lets people see your information as appropriate
    to the responsibilities of their job. For example, only health care
    teams (physicians, nurses, pharmacists, and other licensed health professionals)
    will be able to see detailed medical information.</font></p>
<h3><font face="Helvetica Neue" size="2"><b>Can I change my mind?</b></font></h3>
<p><font face="Helvetica Neue Light" size="2">Yes. You can change your
    mind at anytime and withdraw consent.&nbsp; There will be no future
    sharing of your information, although information that has already been
    shared cannot be returned and basic demographic information will remain
    in the look up list for identification purposes only.</font></p>
<h3><font face="Helvetica Neue" size="2"><b>Where can I get more information?</b></font></h3>
<p><font face="Helvetica Neue Light" size="2">This agency has a brochure
    about CAISI, and can answer other questions for you. CAISI also has
    a web site with more information about itself at: </font><a href="http://www.oscarcanada.org/caisi" target="_blank"><font

<p><font face="Helvetica Neue Light" size="2">On weekdays, phone 416-864-3347</font></p>


<h3><font face="Helvetica Neue" size="2"><b>What do I do next?</b></font></h3>
<p><font face="Helvetica Neue Light" size="2">If you feel like you are ready to make a decision about consent, you can
    sign the consent form below. You can choose to give full consent or refuse to give consent. If there is a specific
    agency that you don't want other agencies to know you have visited, you can exclude that agency from consent. That
    agency would still see other records but no one would see that you had been to that agency.</font></p>
<p><font face="Helvetica Neue Light" size="2">If you want more information
    before you make a decision, ask your caregivers questions or ask them
    to get the information you need. You are under no pressure to give consent
    and can take your time deciding.</font>
