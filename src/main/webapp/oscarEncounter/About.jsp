				<p><u>About Us</u></p>
				
				<p>OSCAR through its product suite and partnerships offers a unique model for connecting care and creating community.

Together these individuals form the OSCAR community known as the OSCAR Canada Users Society (OCUS). The enthusiasm of the OSCAR Community to improve patient care has brought together dedicated individuals from across the country who work towards continuously developing the not only the software tools to enable this, but also a strong community to support it.</p>
